        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <section class="company-description">
            <p>Raging Lemur is a unique service specializing in the training and placement of animals for practical household and entertainment tasks. Our approach combines animal behavior science with practical application, creating meaningful partnerships between humans and their animal assistants.</p>
            
            <p>Founded on the principle that animals possess remarkable natural abilities that can be harnessed for human benefit, Raging Lemur carefully selects species based on their physical capabilities, intelligence, and temperament. Each animal undergoes extensive training using positive reinforcement techniques, ensuring both effectiveness and animal welfare.</p>
            
            <p>Our training programs are developed in collaboration with veterinary behaviorists and animal care specialists. We maintain strict standards for animal health, living conditions, and ongoing care. Every animal in our program receives regular veterinary checkups and behavioral assessments to ensure they remain happy and healthy in their working roles.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Training Philosophy</h3>
            <p>At the core of Raging Lemur's success is our commitment to ethical training practices. We believe that well-trained animals are happy animals. Our methods focus on building trust and confidence rather than relying on punishment or coercion. This approach not only produces more reliable workers but also creates stronger bonds between animals and their human partners.</p>
            
            <p>The Raging Lemur mascot represents the focused determination and playful spirit that characterizes our approach. While our mascot may appear fierce, it symbolizes the concentrated effort and passion we bring to every training session and client relationship.</p>
            
            <h3>Service Commitment</h3>
            <p>We maintain a limited selection of services to ensure we can provide exceptional care and training quality. Our current offerings include specialized assistance with household chores, beverage service, cleaning tasks, and entertainment. Each service is tailored to meet specific client needs while maintaining our high standards of animal welfare and performance reliability.</p>
            
            <p>Raging Lemur is more than a service providerâ€”we're dedicated to demonstrating the incredible potential of the human-animal partnership. Our goal is to make everyday tasks more manageable and enjoyable through the unique abilities of well-trained animals.</p>
