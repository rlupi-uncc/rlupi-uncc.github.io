          <h3><a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a></h3>
          <p class="desc">
            Stripe is a modern payments/fintech website with a strong focus on clarity, readable docs, and consistent UI components.
          </p>
    
          <ul class="crap-list">
            <li><strong>Contrast</strong> — Even with the colorful backgound and design, maintains readabliity.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition</strong> — Repeated component styles, icons, and consistent spacing across pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment</strong> — Grid-based layout where content and controls align predictably.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity</strong> — Related information is grouped together, and certain items stick to keep them near relevant information</li>
          </ul>
    
          <p class="assessment">
            Overall: Follows CRAP well — clear typography and spacing make content scannable. Clean and repeated UI patterns help with muscle memory and learning the product.

          <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">art.yale.edu</a></h3>
          <p class="desc">
            Art.yale has poor organization, lack of cohesive color scheme, many competing visual elements, and a very busy page.
          </p>
    
          <ul class="crap-list">
            <li><strong>Contrast</strong> — Background has too much color variation, and the page has too many conflicting colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition</strong> — Very little consistent repetition of typography/controls. Many different styles are mixed together with a lack of cohesion.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment</strong> — Elements of the screen are very cluttered on the left side, and the right side remains completely empty.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity</strong> — Lots of unrelated items packed together with no real direction as to what you might find where.</li>
          </ul>
    
          <p class="assessment">
            Overall: Breaks almost all possible design rules, creating a confusing, unpleasant experience to view.
