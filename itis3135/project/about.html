      <summary>Our History</summary>
      <p>
        Founded in the early 1980s, Preston Forest grew into a close-knit neighborhood
        with residents who value connection and care for the environment. The association
        began when homeowners saw the need for coordination in maintaining common areas
        and communicating with city partners. Over the years, PFNA has led numerous
        beautification projects and community gatherings that keep the spirit of Preston
        Forest alive.
