                <h3>Personal Background</h3>
                <p>I grew up in New Mexico, and moved to Charlotte for school. I grew up playing football and running track, so I'm a huge fan of sports and staying active. I also played the violin for over 10 years, so music is a big part of my life as well. My favorite thing about computer science is being presented with a difficult problem, and putting the pieces together to solve it.</p>
