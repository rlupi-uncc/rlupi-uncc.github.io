        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>I’m a Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, concentrating in Software Engineering. My coursework in data structures, algorithms, databases, and software design has given me a strong foundation, which I’ve been able to apply directly through industry experience.</p>

            <p>Most recently, I interned as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, where I built Android and React Native features for the Amazon Shopper Panel app and helped optimize VPN networking operations, saving the company significant infrastructure costs. I’m also a Data Science Intern with the Department of Homeland Security, where I’ve developed data pipelines, built web applications, and improved testing processes to make systems more reliable and efficient. I enjoy tackling complex problems, whether that’s through low-level programming in C or building scalable web applications with React and cloud services like AWS and Azure.</p>
